## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Introduction

Hello! My name is **RUOCEHNYANG**, and I am a *first-year* master's student in *Data Science* at UBC.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")

library(tidyverse)
# Read CSV file (adjust the path if needed)
sales <- read_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Preview the first few rows
head(sales)

# Display structure of the dataset
str(sales)
# Remove duplicate rows
sales <- distinct(sales)

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(sales))
sales_ny <- filter(sales, `Store Location` == "New York")
head(sales_ny)
sales_ny %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`Total Sales`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  slice(1)

sales %>%
  count(`Payment Method`, sort = TRUE)
```

Visualizition

```{r}
ggplot(sales, aes(x = `Customer Age`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Customer Age", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(sales, aes(x = `Quantity Sold`, y = Price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Quantity and Price",
    x = "Quantity Sold",
    y = "Price"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Conclusion

As shown in @fig-quantity-price, there appears to be a negative relationship between quantity sold and price â€” as the quantity increases, the price tends to decrease slightly.
